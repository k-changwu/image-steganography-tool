- **Katherine** 🧊  
Created the repo and edited the google form. Got situated with how Processing works by looking at previous assignments from Mr. K's APCS class.  
- **Rickey** 🌪️  
Initialized the README.md. Further fleshed out how the idea of the project will work; decided that at the very least having a color cycling feature in our tool similar to that of Task 16 in TryHackMe CTF collection volume 1.

Did research on potential additonal features of the tool (in addition to LSB and color cycling). Looked into combining Blowfish Algorithm and DCT Steganography. Proposed idea of implementing other ciphers such as Vignere and Caesar in the same way.
